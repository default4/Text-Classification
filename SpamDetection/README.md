## Overview:

This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies the nature of a given SMS message. The project employs Python programming language and various popular libraries to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dependencies:

* Python 3.7+
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Requests

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

$ pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn requests
